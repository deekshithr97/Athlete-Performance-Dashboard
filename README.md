# Athlete-Performance-Dashboard

A sleek, interactive dashboard built using TypeScript and Vite to visualize and monitor athlete performance metrics in real time.

## 🚀 Overview

This project provides a responsive, modern web interface that allows coaches, sports analysts, and fitness teams to easily track, analyze, and compare performance data for individual athletes or teams. With a clean UI and strong typing via TypeScript, it’s built for both usability and maintainability.

## 🔧 Key Features

* Fast, reactive front-end built with Vite and TypeScript.
* Modular component architecture in the `components` folder for easy reuse and extension.
* Typed models and constants (via `types.ts`, `constants.ts`), enforcing consistency across the codebase.
* Single-page app structure: entry via `index.tsx`, main application wrapper in `App.tsx`.
* A configuration file (`vite.config.ts`) pre-set for development workflows.
* Lightweight HTML shell (`index.html`) and strict TS configuration (`tsconfig.json`) ensuring a production-ready build.

## 🧪 Getting Started

To set up and run the dashboard locally:

```bash
# Requirements: Node.js installed  
npm install       # install dependencies  
npm run dev       # run the development server  
```

After this, open your browser to the shown local address to view and interact with the dashboard.

## 🎯 Ideal Use-Cases

* Tracking athlete training metrics (speed, power, recovery, etc.) across time.
* Real-time visualization of team vs athlete performance comparisons.
* Coaching dashboards that require clean, customizable UI with tight front-end architecture.
* Base project for building more advanced sports analytics platforms (e.g., with backend integrations, live telemetry, ML-based predictions).

## 🔍 Why This Approach?

By focusing strictly on front-end architecture and using TypeScript, this dashboard offers:

* **Maintainability** — strongly typed code means fewer runtime surprises.
* **Scalability** — modular components and architecture make it easier to expand features.
* **Performance** — Vite ensures fast builds and hot-reload during development.
* **Flexibility** — ideal for connecting to various backend/data sources later (APIs, streaming data).

## 🛠 Next Steps / Extensions

Future enhancements might include:

* Integrating a REST or GraphQL API to fetch live athlete data.
* Adding charting and analytics (e.g., with libraries like D3 or Chart.js) to visualise trends and comparisons.
* Implementing role-based access (coach vs athlete vs analyst).
* Deploying to cloud (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) with CI/CD for automatic updates.
* Adding predictive models (e.g., injury risk, performance forecasting) feeding into the dashboard.
